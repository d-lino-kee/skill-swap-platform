SkillSwap

Project Overview

GitHub Repository: SkillSwap GitHubTrello Board: SkillSwap Trello

SkillSwap is an innovative peer-to-peer learning platform that empowers users to exchange skills with others in a mutually beneficial way. Unlike traditional e-learning platforms that require expensive subscriptions or one-time payments, SkillSwap creates a collaborative and cost-free learning environment where users teach and learn from one another based on shared interests and availability. This fosters community engagement and allows for personalized, flexible learning experiences.

Core Features

1️⃣ User Registration, Login & Profile Management

Users register and log in using Firebase Authentication, ensuring secure access.

Profiles include key details such as name, skill(s) they can teach, skill(s) they want to learn, location, time availability, years of experience, and email.

Users can easily edit and update their profiles to reflect new interests and schedule changes.

2️⃣ Skill Matching & Request System

A smart matching system connects users based on the skill they wish to learn and the skill they can teach.

Users can browse through potential matches and send an invite to initiate a skill swap.

Once both users accept the request, contact details are revealed, allowing them to coordinate learning sessions.

This mutual exchange eliminates financial barriers and promotes diverse learning opportunities.

3️⃣ Matches Tab

Pending Matches: Displays users who have requested to swap skills with you but are awaiting your response.

Accepted Matches: Shows users with whom you’ve successfully completed a skill swap.

Users can accept or reject invites directly within the interface, ensuring an intuitive and seamless user experience.

4️⃣ Reviews & Ratings

After successfully completing a skill swap, users can review and rate their learning experience.

Reviews include:

The matched user’s name

A short written message describing the experience

A rating on a scale of 1-5

This feature fosters a trust-based environment, ensuring quality exchanges and improving user credibility over time.

5️⃣ Blog & Discussion Threads

Users can create blog posts by selecting a topic, adding relevant tags, and writing a detailed description.

The blog serves as a discussion forum where users can engage in meaningful conversations.

Other users can comment, ask questions, and contribute to ongoing discussions, making it a space for continuous knowledge sharing beyond direct skill swaps.

Future improvements will focus on making the blog more descriptive to facilitate better engagement.
